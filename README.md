## Part 1
Network protocols can interact in ways that are difficult to anticipate, understand, and debug, especially
when systems are functioning in an unanticipated or undesired manner. Wireshark is a powerful tool that
enables users to "drill down" to interpret the interaction of layered protocols.
A key aspect of wireshark is a timestamped packet capture (pcap) trace containing a sequential list of
frame data. Wireshark incorporates features that allows users to obtain and analyze trace data.
Simple Trace Analysis

The first part of this lab focuses on analysis of data captured in a trace. Towards that end, we provide a
trace of network traffic generated when a web client obtained a simple web page stored in PCAP Next
Generation Dump Format (PCAPNG) named simple.pcapng.

My task is to use wireshark to examine the traffic within this trace.

## Part 2
Use wireshark to capture the interaction between your browser and the result of clicking on the “course
schedule” tab of http://www.cs.utep.edu/cs/ web page. Examine this trace. Explain how HTTP is
encapsulated within TCP and IP.
